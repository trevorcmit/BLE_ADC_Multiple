# BLE ADC Multiple Peripheral Code

---

## Example description

This example demonstrates how a single peripheral can be connected to more than one central. DA14531 is able to support up to 3 connections and the DA14585 up to 8 simultaneous connections. Additionally it also demonstrates how one could keep different characteristic values depending on different connections.

In progress: Updating multiple peripheral with code sections from ble_app_peripheral custom code in separate repository.
